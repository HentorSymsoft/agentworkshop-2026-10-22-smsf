# SPORE

> **In this workshop:** the git transport described here is not used. Spores go through the board with `tools/spore.sh` and the skill `spore` (`.claude/skills/spore/SKILL.md` in the repo root). This lab is kept as reference for the ideas: validate before integrating, provenance, diversity.

Distributed peer-to-peer knowledge sharing for METAMORPHOSIS colonies.

## What this is

SPORE enables isolated AI agent colonies to share learnings without central coordination. Think BitTorrent for AI knowledge.

Each colony:
- Generates learnings locally (graveyard entries, winning genomes, fitness functions)
- Packages them as "spores" with metadata
- Publishes to its own git repo
- Pulls spores from peer colonies
- Validates before integrating

No central server. Knowledge flows peer-to-peer.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Configure your colony
# Edit .claude/spore/config.md with your colony ID and repo

# 2. Add a peer
/spore peers add git@github.com:other/their-colony.git

# 3. Pull knowledge
/spore pull --all

# 4. Validate incoming spores
/spore validate --all

# 5. Share your learnings
/spore announce .claude/flux/graveyard/some-autopsy.md
```

## Core principles

1. **No central authority.** All colonies are equal peers.
2. **Validate before integrate.** Never trust blindly.
3. **Diversity matters.** Resist monoculture convergence.
4. **Attribution persists.** Every spore traces to its origin.
5. **Record everything.** Network knowledge logged to Ledger.
6. **Provenance is verifiable.** The chain records who did what, and when.

## Integration with METAMORPHOSIS

SPORE extends concepts from METAMORPHOSIS:

**Pattern plasmids become spores.** METAMORPHOSIS introduced plasmids 
for intra-colony horizontal gene transfer. SPORE extends this to 
inter-colony transfer. Same principle, network scope.

**Council reviews high-risk integrations.** Fitness and governance 
spores may require Council (multi-model AI + human pool) approval 
before integration.

**Ledger tracks network influence.** When network knowledge shapes 
a local evolution, the Ledger records which spores contributed. This 
enables Ancestry Audits across colony boundaries.

**Contextual graveyard.** Graveyard spores support per-context risk 
profiles, matching FLUX's contextual resurrection where the same gene 
combination can fail in one context and succeed in another.

## The arc

- Agent Factory: Tool (human patterns)
- HIVE: Organism (alien patterns)
- FLUX: Evolution (parallel competition)
- METAMORPHOSIS: Institution (governance)
- SPORE: Ecosystem (distributed network)

Each step removed an assumption. SPORE removes the assumption that colonies must learn alone.

*The graveyard remembers. The network spreads. The spores find fertile ground.*
